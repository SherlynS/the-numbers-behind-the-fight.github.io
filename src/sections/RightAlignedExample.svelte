                ðŸ“ˆ <strong> Number of loans </strong> are important to consider because
                they allow us to understand how much suppot is being provided to
                new businesses.

                It would be safe to assume that because small business are
                opening, then that would indicate more job opportunities.
                Nationally this is true, but in <strong
                    >Hudson county, NJ</strong
                >
                this isn't the case.

                Let't take a closer look at the data (on the left) in order to
                understand why this is not the case within New Jersey first.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                As you can see from the numbers the total number of loans
                distributed across the years has been increasing, which would be
                considered a great thing because, more jobs = more job
                opportunities, RIGHT ?
