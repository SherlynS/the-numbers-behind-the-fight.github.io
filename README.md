# The Numbers Behind The Fight 
Created by: Sherlyn Saavedra 

This project was created for the KKW BWDC Storytelling Final Project. 

## Context Behind The Project 
This project aims to dive deep into the educational barrier within Hudson County, New Jersey. The lack of financial resources towards education contributes to unemployment. 

1. Why isn't the creation of new bussiness contributing to the decrease in unemployment rate? 
2. What is the main impacting factor for unemployment rate and why? 

The simple answer is: **Education**. 

## Demo

## Main Message/Takeaway 
Lets not focus on who we are helping, Race and gender should not contribute to why we help them, we should focus on **students dreams and vision for a better tommorrow**.
